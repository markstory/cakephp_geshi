h3. Geshi Helper Plugin

This plugin provides a simple helper for adding GeSHI syntax highlighting to
your application.

h3. Installation

Either clone the repository or download a package and place it in a @Geshi@
directory in one of your plugin paths.  For example @app/Plugin/Geshi@.

Don't forget that starting with CakePHP 2.0, you must load plugins manually
in @app/Config/bootstrap.php@. For example, CakePlugin::loadAll()

h3. Usage

h4. Use without Pre-configuration

To use the helper, include the helper in your controller:

	public $helpers = array('Geshi.Geshi');
	
h4. Use with Pre-configuration

To use the helper and specify specific GeSHi features, use the options form
of including helpers:

	public $helpers = array('Geshi.Geshi' => array('set_header_type' => array( 'GESHI_FANCY_LINE_NUMBERS', 5 ) ));
	
Where the passed-in key is a GeSHi function name, and the passed-in values
is an array of values for the function. Note that because GeSHi's own
constants are out of scope at this point, you must quote named constants as
shown above. GeshiHelper will resolve them for you.
	
h4. Methods

**highlight($html)**

This method will scan HTML for @<pre>@ blocks with a known lang attribute.  This
method is good for highlighting code samples in blog posts, or wiki pages.

You can indicate the language of the text in a @<pre>@ block by setting the lang
attribute.  For example:

	<pre lang="php">
	<?php
	echo 'hi'
	</pre>

Will be highlighted as php code.

**highlightText($text, $language)**

This method will highlight @$text@ in @$language@.  Use this method to 
highlight text in any language GeSHI supports.

**highlightText($text, $language, $withStylesheet)**

This is the same method as above, but if you specify true for the optional,
third parameter then the helper will include the GeSHi-generated inline style
sheet.

h4. Use with Inline Configuration

You can configure GeSHI's features from within your views
by accessing the $features variable so: $this->Geshi->features = array(...)

$this->Geshi->features = array( 'geshi_function_name' => array ( 'geshi_parameter', list, values);

Note that GeSHI's constants _are_ in scope here, and so quoting parameter
values is optional from within views.

h4. Previous Versions' Configuration

Note: previous support for a single @geshi.php@ in you @app/Config@ directory
has been dropped due to the limited flexibility that it offered.
